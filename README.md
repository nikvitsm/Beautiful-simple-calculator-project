One of the most beautiful calculators you've ever seen in your life, very functional too, you can add, subtract numbers and even multiply and divide them, it's just mind-blowing, I know.

This masterpiece is written in HTML5, CSS3 and JS by one and only deeZ nUTS.

P.S. There is a little easter egg hidden in the calculator, only the best of the best will have the courage and wit to discover it.

Have a wonderful day stranger. God bless. ðŸŽ…
